Game of learner project

This project aims to contribute to the progress of the health sector by providing users with easy access to health services and products.

This application includes 3 main features that will require regular updates to meet the needs of users.
In this first version, the following features are available.

1. management of organizations (hospital, health insurance institution)

it is currently limited to the creation of an organization and the creation of accesses for each organization.
the update will consist in implementing the management tools specific to each type of embedded organization.

2. patient management

limited for the moment to the creation of the patient's profile. The update will consist in putting in place 
the tools that will allow the patient to subscribe to the insurance and to follow his personal medical record

3. the interface of the Internet user 
allows anyone accessing the portal to view available hospitals and insurance institutions.
